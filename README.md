## Hi, I am Lisa 👋

I’m a Computer Science student from Japan🗾 currently studying in Canada🍁 with a background as a project assistant and interpreter at a website company, where I discovered my passion for building tech-driven solutions. I’m a back-end focused, aspiring full-stack engineer specializing in the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and **React Native**💻.

I’m actively seeking collaborations and tech internship opportunities where I can combine my technical skills with my strengths in communication and project coordination✨.

Feel free to reach me out!
